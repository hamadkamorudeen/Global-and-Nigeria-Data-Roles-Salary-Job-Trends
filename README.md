## Introduction

The rapid digitization of the global economy has led to an unprecedented demand for data professionals across industries. However, the roles, expectations, compensation, and required skills for data-related jobs vary significantly by region. This project aims to compare key global data roles such as Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Machine Learning Engineer across various regions (North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia) to better understand the global landscape of data careers.

This report presents insights into salary distributions, experience levels, and work preferences for data roles globally and in Nigeria. The data is sourced from a Whatsapp group Data Enginnering Community (DEC) survey.


## Key Metrics

The comparison was based on the following metrics:
- Average Annual Salaries (converted to USD and NGN for consistency)
- Core Skills & Tools Required
- Industry Demand
- Career Growth Opportunities
- Regional Differences in Role Expectations



## Skills/Concepts Demonstrated

This project applied a range of data and professional competencies, including:
- Data Collection & Research: Aggregating salary and role data from a whatsapp group called Data Engineering Community (DEC).
- Data Normalization: Adjusting for currency and cost-of-living differences.
- Comparative Analysis: Evaluating similarities and differences across regions.
- Visualization & Reporting: Communicating findings through tables, charts, and summaries.
- Career Intelligence: Understanding global job market trends and skills in demand.

### Analysis

### Salary Comparison
- Data Engineers and ML Engineers consistently earn higher average salaries than Data Analysts globally.
- North America leads in compensation, with the US offering top salaries across all roles.
- Africa and Asia show increasing demand, but salaries are significantly lower due to economic factors and purchasing power parity.

### Skillset Expectations
- Data Analysts focus on Excel, SQL, and BI tools (Power BI, Tableau), with moderate use of Python.
- Data Scientists require advanced Python/R skills, machine learning, statistics, and data storytelling.
- Data Engineers are expected to have deep knowledge of data architecture, ETL pipelines, cloud services (AWS/GCP/Azure), and big data frameworks (Spark, Hadoop).
- ML Engineers must master deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and deployment strategies.

### Regional Trends
- In Africa, there’s a growing focus on Power BI, Excel, and SQL, with Python gaining momentum.
- India and Eastern Europe are recognized for technical depth and are hubs for outsourcing and Research and Development (R&D).
- Europe prioritizes data privacy and compliance alongside technical skills.


### Need Analysis

From the analysis, it highlights the growing demand for clear, comparative insights into global data roles. Aspiring professionals face confusion around role expectations, required skills, and regional salary differences. With remote work and global hiring trends rising, there’s a need to understand how data careers vary across continents. This dashboard addresses these gaps, supporting learners, educators, and employers in making informed decisions and aligning with evolving global industry standards.
